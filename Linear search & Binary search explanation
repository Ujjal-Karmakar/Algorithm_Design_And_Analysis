1. Linear Search (The "Sequential" Way)
Linear search is the most straightforward approach. It works exactly like looking for a specific page in a book by flipping through every single page from the beginning until you find what you're looking for.
•	How it works: It starts at the first element and compares it with the target value. If they don't match, it moves to the second, then the third, and so on.
•	Requirement: None. The data can be in any order (shuffled or sorted).
•	Best for: Small lists or unsorted data.

2. Binary Search (The "Divide and Conquer" Way)
Binary search is much faster, but it’s a bit more "picky"—it only works if your data is already sorted. Think of it like looking up a word in a physical dictionary; you don't start at 'A' and flip every page; you jump to the middle and narrow it down.
•	How it works: 1. Check the middle element of the list.
2. If the middle element is the target, you're done!
3. If the target is smaller than the middle, ignore the right half and repeat the process on the left half.
4. If the target is larger, ignore the left half and repeat on the right.
•	Requirement: The list must be sorted.
•	Best for: Large datasets where speed is critical.
